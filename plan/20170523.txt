Period 4
Project: Bubble Shooter

Which jobs are most crucial? Which components constitute core functionality?
Basic environment of balls in hex arrangement being consistently displayed
When a bubble is launched is must stick to the field of bubbles appropriately to satisfy the hex grid structure, and result in a popping of same color bubbles.
Winning when the field of bubbles is cleared or losing when the field has at least one bubble in each row 

What components are prerequisites for others?
The popping mechanisms requires state vars and neighbor arraylists to be in compliance, and requires for the ball to go into its appropriate slot in the 2D array
The launching of the ball requires the move method in the ball to work appropriately based on the chosen angle which requires the mouse hovering to work

Chronology and Delegation
Create the 2D array with the proper states of each ball and display this 2D array, with ball at bottom
One person should be assigned this task
Get launching to work → the dotted line needs to be drawn correctly and adjust based on mouse hover, and when the ball is launched at a particular angle it follows that proper trajectory (including bouncing off the walls)
One person should be assigned this task
Ensure that a launched ball would adjust slightly and stick in the proper slot when displayed and in the proper slot in the 2D array; get losing mechanism working
One person should be assigned this task
Get popping mechanism to work 
Can be divided, or collaboratively implemented → have to agree on an algo
Be able to declare winning and losing, with score keeping and basic game aspects
One person can be assigned this task
Expanding elements, better visual appeal (To be better contextualized as project progresses)
Everyone

Timeline
Should be finished by monday
Should be finished by monday
Should be finished by wednesday
Should be finished by friday → this version now has complete core functionality, winning must work and losing must work

Running List of Ideas for Post-core Functionality Development
Power-up balls
Visual themes that can be adjusted
Display something cool after a game is completed? Like possibly an animation of all the balls popped in the game piled up on the screen (could use a stacky structure)
What are other ways we can implement new things we learned this year?

Ways that we implement data structures learned this year:
The color of the balls coming up next will be stored in a queue to take advantage of queues’ first in first out property.
Every time the player successfully shoots down a group of bubbles, the bubbles that just fell down would be stored, in order, in a stack. That allows for us to create a undo button, where the last move made can be reversed.
Every time the player successfully shoots down a group of bubbles, he/she gains a certain amount of points. Every time a player scores a certain number of points, the point gained as well as the combination of bubbles that the player shot down will be stored in an arraylist (or any other data structure). At the end of the game, whatever data structure we choose to use will be sorted using a sexy second semester sort (maybe heap or merge sort), this way the player can find out which one of his/her moves gained them the most points 
The popping mechanism, wherein a bubble launched hits a group of 3 or more connected bubbles of the same color, uses recursive backtracking, as we search through the arrayList of neighbors of the ball launch and then search through the neighbor’s neighbors, and so on, finally backtracking back to the original group of neighbors and choosing a different neighbor.
