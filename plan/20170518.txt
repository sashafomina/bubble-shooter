Bubble Shooter!

Which jobs are most crucial? Which components constitute core functionality?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
++When a bubble is launched is must stick to the field of bubbles appropriately to satisfy the hex grid structure, and result in a popping of same color bubbles.

++Winning when the field of bubbles is cleared or losing when the field has at least one bubble in each row 

What components are prerequisites for others?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
++The popping mechanisms requires state vars and neighbor arraylists to be in compliance, and requires for the ball to go into its appropriate slot in the 2D array

++The launching of the ball requires the move method in the ball to work appropriately based on the chosen angle which requires the mouse hovering to work

Chronology and Delegation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Get launching to work ? the dotted line needs to be drawn correctly and adjust based on mouse hover, and when the ball is launched at a particular angle it follows that proper trajectory (including bouncing off the walls)
	---> One person should be assigned this task
2. Create the 2D array with the proper states of each ball and display this 2D array
	---> One person should be assigned this task
3. Ensure that a launched ball would adjust slightly and stick in the proper slot when displayed and in the proper slot in the 2D array; get losing mechanism working
	---> One person should be assigned this task
4. Get popping mechanism to work 
	---> Can be divided, or collaboratively implemented ? have to agree on an algo

Timeline
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Should be finished by monday
2. Should be finished by monday
3. Should be finished by wednesday
4. Should be finished by friday ? this version now has complete core functionality, winning must work and losing must work
